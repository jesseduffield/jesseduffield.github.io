title: "Stepping back"
---

Since I created [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) back in 2018, I've managed to find time for it outside my day job. I've had a blast spending countless afternoons, weekends, and most of my annual leave on the project, but since founding my own startup, [Subble](https://www.subble.com/), it's become ever harder to give Lazygit the time it deserves. So, in order to prevent myself from becoming a blocker on progress, I've decided to step back and hand over the reins to my co-maintainer Stefan Haller.

Anybody who's raised issues or pull requests in Lazygit over the last couple of years will likely already be familiar with Stefan: he's been the number one individual contributor to Lazygit in recent history as well as being the main driver of progress in the repo. Stefan's rigour, humility, and taste are all readily apparent in his contributions so far, and I have full confidence that Lazygit is safe in his hands.

Lazygit remains my pride and joy, and I intend on returning to it once time permits, but I don't know when that will be. In the meantime I'll still be around to give my 2 cents on features whenever needed, and I'll continue proselytising Lazygit any chance I get.

Thanks to everybody who has helped Lazygit come this far. Lazygit is the coolest UI for git, and I look forward to seeing how much cooler it becomes.
